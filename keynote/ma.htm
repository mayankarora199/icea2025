      <b>Biography</b>: Lei Ma is currently an Associate Professor with The University of Tokyo; as
      well as an associate professor and Canada CIFAR AI Chair with University of Alberta. His
      research centers around the interdisciplinary fields of human-centered trustworthy artificial
      intelligence (AI), software engineering (SE), and cyber-physical system (CPS) with a special
      focus on quality, reliability, safety, and security assurance, as well as the interpretation
      and human interactivity of and AI Systems. Many of his works were published in top-tier AI,
      software engineering, and security venues (e.g., TSE, TOSEM, ICSE, FSE, ASE, CAV, ICML,
      NeurIPS, AAAI, IJCAI, TDSC), among which four papers receive the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished
      Paper Awards (ASE 16, ASE 18, ASE 18, FSE 23), and an annual best paper award of 2022 IEEE
      Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE 2022). More information about his recent activities

    <div><b>Title: </b>Towards Trustworthy Assurance of AI Systems in the LLM Era<br /><br /></div>
    <div>
      <b>Abstract:</b> In recent years, deep learning-enabled systems have made remarkable progress,
      powering a surge in advanced intelligent applications. This growth and its real-world impact
      have been further amplified by the advent of large foundation models (e.g., LLM, Stable
      Diffusion). Yet, the rapid evolution of these AI systems often proceeds without comprehensive
      quality assurance and engineering support. This gap is evident in the integration of standards
      for quality, reliability, and safety assurance, as well as the need for mature toolchain
      support that provides systematic and explainable feedback of the development lifecycle. In
      this talk, I will present a high-level overview of our team's ongoing initiatives to lay the
      groundwork for Trustworthy Assurance of AI Systems and its industrial applications.
