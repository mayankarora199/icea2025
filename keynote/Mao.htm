    <div><b>Title: </b> AIGC for Wireless Data Augmentation <br /><br /></div>
    <div>
      <b>Abstract:</b> The performance of deep learning (DL) empowered wireless communications,
      networking, and sensing depends on the availability of sufficient high-quality radio frequency
      (RF) data, which is more difficult and expensive to collect than other types. To overcome this
      obstacle, we propose several AIGC approaches to generate synthetic RF data labeled with
      specified human activities for multiple wireless sensing platforms, such as WiFi, RFID, mmWave
      radar, including a conditional Recurrent Generative Adversarial Network (R-GAN) approach and
      diffusion model based approaches. The high quality of the generated RF data is validated by
      metrics of Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID), as well as
      representative downstream tasks of human activity recognition (HAR), where the model trained
      with sufficient synthesized data outperforms the model trained by real data.
